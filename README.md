# Dapper Generic Repository with Product Repository
This project is a .NET Core implementation of a generic repository using Dapper, along with an example implementation of a product repository that utilizes the generic repository.

## Overview
The repository pattern is a popular design pattern for data access in .NET applications. This project takes the repository pattern a step further by implementing a generic repository using Dapper, a high-performance micro-ORM for .NET. With the generic repository, you can easily perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on any entity in your application.

In addition to the generic repository, this project includes an example implementation of a product repository that uses the generic repository to perform database operations on a products table. The product repository provides methods to get all products, get a product by ID, add a new product, update a product, and delete a product.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or have a improvement request, please open an issue. If you would like to contribute code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the repository pattern and Dapper, and was created to demonstrate how these two concepts can be combined to create a flexible and efficient data access layer for .NET applications.
